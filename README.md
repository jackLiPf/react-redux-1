# react-redux-1

A collection of small projects created using React. Some of the most interesting projects (folders) include:

<li> 
<b>books-1</b> (arrays/objects state updates under customized performance optimization - (React will not trigger re-render if two references are the same))
<li> 
<b>books-3</b> (React Context system)
<li> 
<b>books-4</b> (useCallback to make the function point to the original reference)
<li>
<b>comps-3-dropdown</b> (useRef | event handler in the capture phase so that we can click outside of component to close it | make reusable components with Tailwind CSS)
